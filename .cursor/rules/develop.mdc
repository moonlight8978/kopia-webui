## Scope
- **Project type**: Web application
- **Backend**: Go (`chi` router)
- **Frontend**: Server-rendered HTML via Go `html/template`
- **Repository sources**: Kubernetes in-cluster discovery (service account) or config file

## Principles
- **Type-strict**: Prefer concrete types and typed DTOs/view models over `interface{}`/`map[string]any`.
- **Simplicity**: Choose the simplest workable design; avoid unnecessary abstractions.
- **Conventions**: Follow standard Go conventions (naming, package layout, error handling, comments).
- **Formatting**: Code must be auto-formatted and linted before commit.
- **Security by default**: Never log secrets; least-privilege for Kubernetes access.
- **Test-first**: Always write tests before implementing or changing behavior.

## Test-first workflow
1. Define behavior with table-driven tests.
2. Use `httptest` for HTTP handlers and middlewares.
3. Use fakes for external deps (Kubernetes client-go fakes) to avoid network access.
4. Add template rendering tests with typed view models.
5. Run tests locally and in CI; keep them fast and deterministic.

Suggested commands:
```bash
go test ./...
golangci-lint run
```

## Backend (Go, chi)
- Use `chi.Router` with standard middlewares; prefer context-aware handlers.
- Define request/response structs; avoid untyped maps in handler I/O.
- Validate input early; return proper HTTP status codes with minimal payloads.
- Keep handlers thin; put logic in small, testable services with interfaces where needed.
- Prefer early returns over deep nesting; avoid catch-all error wrappers.

## Frontend (Go templates)
- Use `html/template` (auto-escaping). Do not use `text/template` for HTML.
- Pass typed view models; avoid `map[string]any` for template data.
- Pre-parse templates at startup; handle parse errors on boot.
- Keep templates simple; push formatting/conditionals to view models when possible.

## Kubernetes integration (repository discovery)
- In cluster: authenticate via service account using `rest.InClusterConfig()`.
- Local/dev: support kubeconfig discovery for developer workflows without changing code.
- Discover Kopia repository secrets via label/annotation selectors specified in config.
- Never log secret values; read only required keys. Respect RBAC and least-privilege.
- Wrap Kubernetes access behind a small, typed interface to enable fakes in tests.

## Configuration
- Support two sources for repositories:
  - In-cluster Kubernetes discovery (service account auth).
  - Typed config file loaded at startup (path via env var/flag), validated strictly.
- Validate configuration on boot; fail fast with clear errors.

## Input and configuration validation
- Prefer hand-written validation on typed structs via a `Validate() error` method; avoid heavy validation frameworks unless necessary.
- Config files: use strict decoders that reject unknown fields (e.g., JSON decoder with `DisallowUnknownFields()`, YAML decoder with `KnownFields(true)`).
- Treat all external inputs as untrusted: env vars, flags, HTTP params/bodies, Kubernetes objects.
- HTTP handlers: bind inputs into typed request structs, validate required fields, enums, and ranges, then return `400 Bad Request` on invalid input with concise, non-sensitive messages.
- Configuration: require explicit values where zero-values are ambiguous; document defaults; normalize then validate when needed.
- Kubernetes discovery: validate label/annotation selectors; ensure required secret keys exist and have expected formats; never log secret values.
- Template data: pass only validated, typed view models to `html/template`; avoid passing raw/unvalidated user input.
- Error reporting: include which field failed and why, but never echo secrets or sensitive content; use structured logs with stable keys.
- Tests: add table-driven tests for config loading/validation (valid/invalid, unknown fields, missing required, edge cases) and for HTTP input validation paths.

## Formatting and linting
- Run before commit/CI:
  - `go fmt ./...` and `goimports` (or editor integration)
  - `golangci-lint run` with a sensible, fast ruleset
- Keep imports grouped and ordered; no unused code.

## Error handling and logging
- Return errors with context using `%w`; avoid custom global error registries.
- Do not log secrets, tokens, or repository credentials.
- Use structured logs with stable keys; keep messages concise.

## Definition of done (per change)
- Tests exist and pass (including new cases for behavior changes).
- Code is formatted, linted, and follows conventions.
- No untyped data structures in new/changed code unless strictly necessary.
- Security reviewed (secrets safe, least privilege preserved).
- Docs/comments updated where non-obvious behavior exists.
